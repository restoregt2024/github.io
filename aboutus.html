    <h3>Michael Bosch - Supervisor</h3>

    <div class="description" id="bosch">

        <article>
        <p class="bio">I’m running for Supervisor in Georgetown Charter Township. I’m currently serving as a Treasurer on the Georgetown Township board, I’m also on the Finance Committee as well as the Zoning Board of Appeals. I served as Trustee as well as Services Committee, Zoning Board of Appeals, Construction Board of Appeals and WCET TV Advisory Board from 2016-2020. I’ve been an Ottawa County GOP precinct delegate since 2008, currently serving precinct 3.</p>
        <p class="bio">I am an Unapologetic Christian Pro-Life Pro-Family Second Amendment Loving Constitutional Conservative Republican American Patriot that believes in limited government, personal responsibility and fiscally conservative spending. I have lived and worshiped here in Georgetown Township for over 48 years now. My wife and I are raising our daughters here and I want them to have the same, an opportunity to live in a great community that’s financially stable with a focused vision for the future. I am a graduate of Jenison Public Schools and I received my Bachelor’s degree from Grand Valley State University. I also have a background in residential construction and automotive refinishing and repair. I was a senior graphic artist for Adobe Systems Inc prior to starting my own graphic design & photography business in 1997. I have shifted my focus to residential construction and investment properties. As a home owner and business owner in Georgetown I fully understand the obstacles our residents and businesses face and have been working on their behalf since being elected in 2016.</p>
        <p class="bio">Over the past 7.5 years as your treasurer and trustee I have been to all but 1 board meetings, ALL special and finance committee meetings (I also attend services, planning and utilities meetings, despite not being on those committees, I always want to stay informed on all township items). I have the best attendance record of any board member because I take my oath of office and my commitment to those who elected me very seriously! I have spent hundreds of hours researching proposed spending, going over monthly township bills as well as reviewing agendas looking for the most cost effective solutions that meet the needs of our community so I will be ready to go on day one if elected as Supervisor. I’m a fiscal hawk, I spend 10-20 hours per week on township business, I don’t do it for the money, I do it because I want to give back in appreciation for all that Georgetown has given me growing up and living here. Since taking office in 2016 I have worked hard for my constituents and local businesses.</p>
        <p class="bio">One of my first accomplishments after taking office in 2016 was removing unconstitutional language from our ordinances. There was anti-2nd amendment language that would have created an opportunity for a lawsuit which would have cost our taxpayers a lot of money.</p>
        <p class="bio">Another success was requiring requiring our taxpayer funded assets to be sold at public auction to be sure we get the most money back when it’s time for replacement. The first result of this policy was an aging dumpbed truck that was going to be traded in for $3,500.00, it went to auction and sold for $13,000.00! While that’s not huge amount it all adds up and it’s also part of my fiduciary duty to my taxpayers.</p>
        <p class="bio">I was successful in instituting new road resurfacing policies & procedures which have resulted in better pricing, increased roads lists each year and saving taxpayer money. In years past we had a conflicting 2 different grading system evaluation list. I proposed a neighborhood/block procedure, which saves time and money by focusing on completing the whole neighborhood rather than just one or two streets. Previous to this new policy resurfacing crews and equipment were zigzagging across the township, not a very efficient way to do it. We also now take into consideration the “PASER” scale rating, the last time it was resurfaced, when it was originally built, the amount of traffic the road receives as well as other data to be sure we are using taxpayer money wisely.</p>
        <p class="bio">I have been fighting for the easing of temporary/permanent sign ordinances in our township so businesses have an opportunity to advertise their services/products, I received zero support. I’ve also been fighting against eminent domain and unconstitutional takings, sometimes I’ll get one “show vote” from a colleague but not often. I’ve also been an advocate for requests for sidewalk waivers where applicable (sidewalks to nowhere, a HUGE expense for business owners and developers). One business developer wanted a waiver for a new development that would have been a great asset to our community, his sidewalk would have been a sidewalk to nowhere since properties on both sides of theirs had none and never would. The sidewalk/fill cost for him to install sidewalks would be in excess of $250,000.00! I was the only board member in favor of granting the waiver and was outvoted. The project was cancelled, cost prohibitive…another future business in GT lost! I also fought for revision to an outdated industrial ordinance that was going to force a business to leave Georgetown. I proposed the revision, did my due diligence with PCI (building inspectors), our code enforcer, zoning administrator and Fire Chief to make sure the revision wouldn’t have a negative impact on our community. That revision allowed the business to remain in GT and expand, retaining that tax revenue and even more, a win for both the township, schools and business!</p>
        <p class="bio">Since 2016 I have been proposing reducing our tax millage from 2.75 to 2.00 to help both residents and businesses, the township over taxes $1-3 million every year. I achieved part of that goal in 2020 with a .5 mill reduction to 2.5 mills, with a new board we will get down to 2.00, possibly lower. I’m all for beautification in our township but spending $1 Million on a miniature clock tower and wall (and not fixing a disfunctional corner!), we could do something very nice at 1/10th that cost. This isn’t Calabasas California, that’s money that could be spent for parks or projects that can actually be used and enjoyed by our residents. It’s all about vision casting, goals and cost vs benefit, not willy nilly blank check spending at the taxpayers expense.</p>
        <p class="bio">We’ve lost millions on failed real estate transactions (kmart boondoggle, selling our $6.5 million dollar ice arena for $500k !!!), selling out our cell tower leases (killing the golden goose) and millions in never ending wasteful spending projects without involving our residents and businesses in these decisions. I don’t support “cherry picked” “ad hoc” committees to push an agenda, I want input from a true cross-section of our entire community. I would like quarterly town hall meetings to gather true input from all residents and businesses (I’ve proposed them at every yearly goal setting meeting, again, no support). I would like to create a business committee with representatives of the board as well as actual business owners in our community to find out how we can work together as a team for the betterment of the entire community. In 2022 we did a resident survey and had 2,700 responses. The number 1 response was “stop wasting my money and lower my taxes”, it was not the answer 5 out of seven board members wanted to hear so it was swept under the rug as if it never happened. I read EVERY single response, with a new board we will honor the will of those who’s survey response was ignored.</p>
        <p class="bio">I would like to bring back what we had just 12 years ago, a fiscally conservative board that listens to and works for our residents and businesses, the township seems to have lost touch with the community starting in 2012, together we will get it back on track.</p>
        <p class="bio">I would humbly ask for your vote for Supervisor because I’ve been fighting for you since being elected in 2016 and before. I have never forgotten who I work for, you the taxpayers. I have been and will continue to be your voice at the township level. You are my boss, I work for you. That’s what makes me a representative and not your typical politician.</p>
        <p class="bio">This is a pivotal election August 6th, we need to elect board members that work for and listen to our taxpayers. It has been an honor to work for the taxpayers of Georgetown Township and I hope to serve you as Supervisor in the future.</p>
