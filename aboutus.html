    <h3>Michael Bosch - Supervisor</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleDescription('bosch')">Read More</button>
    <div class="description" id="bosch">
        <article>
        <p class="bio">I’m running for Supervisor in Georgetown Charter Township. I’m currently serving as a Treasurer on the Georgetown Township board, I’m also on the Finance Committee as well as the Zoning Board of Appeals. I served as Trustee as well as Services Committee, Zoning Board of Appeals, Construction Board of Appeals and WCET TV Advisory Board from 2016-2020. I’ve been an Ottawa County GOP precinct delegate since 2008, currently serving precinct 3.</p>
        <p class="bio">I am an Unapologetic Christian Pro-Life Pro-Family Second Amendment Loving Constitutional Conservative Republican American Patriot that believes in limited government, personal responsibility and fiscally conservative spending. I have lived and worshiped here in Georgetown Township for over 48 years now. My wife and I are raising our daughters here and I want them to have the same, an opportunity to live in a great community that’s financially stable with a focused vision for the future. I am a graduate of Jenison Public Schools and I received my Bachelor’s degree from Grand Valley State University. I also have a background in residential construction and automotive refinishing and repair. I was a senior graphic artist for Adobe Systems Inc prior to starting my own graphic design & photography business in 1997. I have shifted my focus to residential construction and investment properties. As a home owner and business owner in Georgetown I fully understand the obstacles our residents and businesses face and have been working on their behalf since being elected in 2016.</p>
        <p class="bio">Over the past 7.5 years as your treasurer and trustee I have been to all but 1 board meetings, ALL special and finance committee meetings (I also attend services, planning and utilities meetings, despite not being on those committees, I always want to stay informed on all township items). I have the best attendance record of any board member because I take my oath of office and my commitment to those who elected me very seriously! I have spent hundreds of hours researching proposed spending, going over monthly township bills as well as reviewing agendas looking for the most cost effective solutions that meet the needs of our community so I will be ready to go on day one if elected as Supervisor. I’m a fiscal hawk, I spend 10-20 hours per week on township business, I don’t do it for the money, I do it because I want to give back in appreciation for all that Georgetown has given me growing up and living here. Since taking office in 2016 I have worked hard for my constituents and local businesses.</p>
        <p class="bio">One of my first accomplishments after taking office in 2016 was removing unconstitutional language from our ordinances. There was anti-2nd amendment language that would have created an opportunity for a lawsuit which would have cost our taxpayers a lot of money.</p>
        <p class="bio">Another success was requiring our taxpayer funded assets to be sold at public auction to be sure we get the most money back when it’s time for replacement. The first result of this policy was an aging dumpbed truck that was going to be traded in for $3,500.00, it went to auction and sold for $13,000.00! While that’s not huge amount it all adds up and it’s also part of my fiduciary duty to my taxpayers.</p>
        <p class="bio">I was successful in instituting new road resurfacing policies & procedures which have resulted in better pricing, increased roads lists each year and saving taxpayer money. In years past we had a conflicting 2 different grading system evaluation list. I proposed a neighborhood/block procedure, which saves time and money by focusing on completing the whole neighborhood rather than just one or two streets. Previous to this new policy resurfacing crews and equipment were zigzagging across the township, not a very efficient way to do it. We also now take into consideration the “PASER” scale rating, the last time it was resurfaced, when it was originally built, the amount of traffic the road receives as well as other data to be sure we are using taxpayer money wisely.</p>
        <p class="bio">I have been fighting for the easing of temporary/permanent sign ordinances in our township so businesses have an opportunity to advertise their services/products, I received zero support. I’ve also been fighting against eminent domain and unconstitutional takings, sometimes I’ll get one “show vote” from a colleague but not often. I’ve also been an advocate for requests for sidewalk waivers where applicable (sidewalks to nowhere, a HUGE expense for business owners and developers). One business developer wanted a waiver for a new development that would have been a great asset to our community, his sidewalk would have been a sidewalk to nowhere since properties on both sides of theirs had none and never would. The sidewalk/fill cost for him to install sidewalks would be in excess of $250,000.00! I was the only board member in favor of granting the waiver and was outvoted. The project was cancelled, cost prohibitive…another future business in GT lost! I also fought for revision to an outdated industrial ordinance that was going to force a business to leave Georgetown. I proposed the revision, did my due diligence with PCI (building inspectors), our code enforcer, zoning administrator and Fire Chief to make sure the revision wouldn’t have a negative impact on our community. That revision allowed the business to remain in GT and expand, retaining that tax revenue and even more, a win for both the township, schools and business!</p>
        <p class="bio">Since 2016 I have been proposing reducing our tax millage from 2.75 to 2.00 to help both residents and businesses, the township over taxes $1-3 million every year. I achieved part of that goal in 2020 with a .5 mill reduction to 2.25 mills, with a new board we will get down to 2.00, possibly lower. I’m all for beautification in our township but spending $1 Million on a miniature clock tower and wall (and not fixing a disfunctional corner!), we could do something very nice at 1/10th that cost. This isn’t Calabasas California, that’s money that could be spent for parks or projects that can actually be used and enjoyed by our residents. It’s all about vision casting, goals and cost vs benefit, not willy nilly blank check spending at the taxpayers expense.</p>
        <p class="bio">We’ve lost millions on failed real estate transactions (kmart boondoggle, selling our $6.5 million dollar ice arena for $500k !!!), selling out our cell tower leases (killing the golden goose) and millions in never ending wasteful spending projects without involving our residents and businesses in these decisions. I don’t support “cherry picked” “ad hoc” committees to push an agenda, I want input from a true cross-section of our entire community. I would like quarterly town hall meetings to gather true input from all residents and businesses (I’ve proposed them at every yearly goal setting meeting, again, no support). I would like to create a business committee with representatives of the board as well as actual business owners in our community to find out how we can work together as a team for the betterment of the entire community. In 2022 we did a resident survey and had 2,700 responses. The number 1 response was “stop wasting my money and lower my taxes”, it was not the answer 5 out of seven board members wanted to hear so it was swept under the rug as if it never happened. I read EVERY single response, with a new board we will honor the will of those who’s survey response was ignored.</p>
        <p class="bio">I would like to bring back what we had just 12 years ago, a fiscally conservative board that listens to and works for our residents and businesses, the township seems to have lost touch with the community starting in 2012, together we will get it back on track.</p>
        <p class="bio">I would humbly ask for your vote for Supervisor because I’ve been fighting for you since being elected in 2016 and before. I have never forgotten who I work for, you the taxpayers. I have been and will continue to be your voice at the township level. You are my boss, I work for you. That’s what makes me a representative and not your typical politician.</p>
        <p class="bio">This is a pivotal election August 6th, we need to elect board members that work for and listen to our taxpayers. It has been an honor to work for the taxpayers of Georgetown Township and I hope to serve you as Supervisor in the future.</p>

    <h3>Kim VanderLey - Trustee</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleDescription('vanderley')">Read More</button>
    <div class="description" id="vanderley">
        <article>
        <p class="bio">Kimberly is a native of Michigan, residing in Georgetown Township for 34 years. She and her husband, John, have been married for 44 years and have three adult sons. Kimberly is a Registered Nurse for 40+ years, and has earned a Masters in Nursing Education from Western Governors University. Her career includes Hospital employment in Intensive Care (ICU), Medical/Surgical care, and teaching/leadership roles as a Clinical Instructor in laboratory and Hospital settings. Over the years she has taught science classes to elementary and middle school children.</p>
        <p class="bio">Kimberly is first committed to her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. She is committed to traditional conservative principles, and respects the constitution as a fundamental guide in all matters of liberty and freedom. She will fight to protect the inalienable rights of all Georgetown Township residents.
</p>
        <p class="bio">Kimberly's background in the medical field as a Registered Nurse gives her a wide range of skills to draw upon; skills such as leadership, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, listening with understanding and conflict resolution.
There will be occasions when complete understanding requires time and much dialog to provide clarity in difficult situations.</p>
      <p class="bio">Kim actively serves as an Ottawa County Precinct Delegate, and volunteers her time to serve our community. She emphasizes health and wellness education for any person seeking health and healing. This includes the under served residents who have unspoken needs. Kim's attitude is always to serve others in any way she can! </p>
    <p class="bio">Kim realizes the importance of being informed about world events, government leaders' views and how their ideas and concepts impact lives of Georgetown Township citizens. In order to understand this, she uses her research skills to fine answers to these questions.</p>
    <p class="bio">I have desired to become actively involved in politics, not for power but to positively impact change for each of our lives. We need to take back everything that has been taken from us during these past 4 years.  I promise to use your money wisely, and decrease fees as much as possible. I contend that the increased water and sewer rates, which went up by 35% and 37% respectively, are excessive and must be returned to previous levels.</p>
    <p class="bio">Another wasteful Township expenditure was building an Ice Arena which cost the township residents $6.5 million, not including the extras that were added. Then the present board sold the facility and property for $500 thousand. A net loss of at least $6 million. No assessment done, no open market value obtained, not listed so other bids could be considered.</p>
    <p class="bio">I do not believe it is the township board's job to build and operate any business, it is the private sector that needs to provide businesses that will benefit our community.</p>
    <p class="bio">It is time for a change! Let us make Georgetown Township a beacon of light and hope again.</p>
    <p class="bio">I will appreciate your vote on the August 6th Primary Election!</p>
    <p class="bio">If you have any questions or comments, I invite you to contact me by email at                k.vanderley@protonmail.com </p>

        <article>
        <p class="bio">I come from a large family of eight children. It is there that I learned my faith in God, the love of a family, hard work and the value of a dollar. I was born and raised in West Michigan with 30+ years enjoying what Georgetown Township has to offer. I am married to Kim, my high school sweetheart. We have 3 adult children. I have a bachelor degree of Business Administration and Facilities Management from Grand Valley State University.</p>
        <p class="bio">My career has been wide &amp; expansive with large NASDAQ technology companies, focused primarily in computer networking and data storage markets. I bring unique talents such as leadership, communication, team building and thinking outside the box for solutions. My attitude is that of a servant, in that, I am willing to help out just about anyone with my time, effort and energy; such as, coaching Little League baseball and softball, helping my neighbors with projects that they can’t do themselves, helping others at their churches with projects and lending a hand when someone is struggling.</p>
        <p class="bio">My interest in politics has always been within me, but raising children, and finding a way to pay the bills was always more important. That changed with all the “craziness” that is happening in the state and locally. It as if we have lost our way. I was like a lot of you. I did nothing but complain when I saw things that were wrong. I then reached the point of either “sit down and be quiet” or “do something about it”. I chose to do something. I became a delegate for precinct 13, so I could represent my neighbors in the political process. That experience was transformative for me.</p>
        <p class="bio">This led me to go to Georgetown Township Board meetings. I was so surprised on how the Township’s business was conducted. It was conducted with little or no public input or consideration for the taxpayer. I was even more surprised that the public subcommittees are not recorded. This got me to start looking into other areas of our local government.</p>
        <p class="bio">I am sure you will be surprised to learn that the assessor of Georgetown Township has now been out-sourced to Ottawa County for $2.2 million on a 4 year contract ($550K/year). The current board has used tax dollars to pay county bureaucrats to take local control from Georgetown. That is not the stewardship/representation I want. Giving up control of our property tax assessment to an un-elected bureaucrat at the county makes no sense to me. I believe this leads to accelerating property values at much higher rate and to higher taxes.</p>
        <p class="bio">I have been going to board meetings and subcommittee meetings for months. During all these months, there has never been a vote to decline a spending request. I watch our current treasurer, Mike Bosch, fight for the tax payer every meeting (review board video May 13 at the 1:18 mark). Only to be chastised by current board members and then never voting to reduce taxes. At least they could have held a voted.</p>
        <p class="bio">We can do better. The voters and tax payer deserve better. I will do better. I will be unabashed to commit myself to the betterment of Georgetown Township. I will work hard to restore it to the township that I fell in love with when I came here so long ago.</p>
